			<p>I am a full stack developer with experience in Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, JQuery, HTML, CSS, SQL, AngularJS, Ionic, mongoDB, and Node, among others.</p>

			<p>After two years spent traveling, learning about myself, and the world, I developed a passion in web development as an outlet for my creativity. This passion lead me to Dev Bootcamp, in which I spent over 1000 hours learning to be an effective teammate and web developer. Using AGILE strategies, I worked with teams to build full stack web and mobile applications. Throughout the course, I learned about object oriented programming, with an emphasis on producing DRY, maintainable, and readable code.</p>
