		<p>I am a full stack developer with experience in Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, JQuery, HTML, CSS, SQL, AngularJS, Ionic, mongoDB, and Node, among others.</p>

		<p>After two years spent traveling, learning about myself, and the world, I developed a passion in web development as an outlet for my creativity. This passion lead me to Dev Bootcamp, in which I spent over 1000 hours learning to be an effective teammate and web developer. Using AGILE strategies, I worked with teams to build full stack web and mobile applications. Throughout the course, I learned about object oriented programming, with an emphasis on producing DRY, maintainable, and readable code.</p>

		<h2>CloudScript</h2><a href="www.github.com/pfeffer629/CloudScript"><img class="github" src="../imgs/github.png"></a>
		<p>A doctor/patient communication and prescription management web and mobile app that allows users to video chat and message with their doctor in real time while allowing patients to fill prescriptions and have them delivered in under 90 minutes. I was team lead for this week-long project where we ambitiously chose to develop the app with completely unfamiliar technologies including io.js, Node, Express, Angular, MongoDB,Firebase, WebRTC Gulp and AWS.</p>

		<p>Over the week developing both the web and mobile app, our team was able to rapidly learn and apply more than just the skills required for building with brand new technologies, but also the importance of team dynamics and soft skills. We learned about the importance of team communication, individual personalities, feedback and engineering empathy.</p>
