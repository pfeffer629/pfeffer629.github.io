		<h2>CloudScript</h2><a href="www.github.com/pfeffer629/CloudScript"><img class="github" src="../imgs/github.png"></a>
		<p>A doctor/patient communication and prescription management web and mobile app that allows users to video chat and message with their doctor in real time while allowing patients to fill prescriptions and have them delivered in under 90 minutes. I was team lead for this week-long project where we ambitiously chose to develop the app with completely unfamiliar technologies including io.js, Node, Express, Angular, MongoDB,Firebase, WebRTC Gulp and AWS.</p>

		<p>Over the week developing both the web and mobile app, our team was able to rapidly learn and apply more than just the skills required for building with brand new technologies, but also the importance of team dynamics and soft skills. We learned about the importance of team communication, individual personalities, feedback and engineering empathy.</p>
