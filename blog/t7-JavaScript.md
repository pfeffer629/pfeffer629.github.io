I had a great time learning Ruby. I always loved solving puzzles, and Ruby, to me, was a way of doing that. My experience learning JavaScript was similar. The logic behind it was nearly, if not exactly, identical to Ruby. It seemed to be more like a different dialect rather than a different language. Because of this, the transition from one to the other was not too difficult.

Although the underlying principles were very similar, the differences were still essential to recognize. The way of expressing ideas had a different format, that, if written incorrectly, would not work. One such example is the difference between Ruby hashes and JavaScript objects. In JavaScript, the first thing that sticks out is that var must be typed before creating an object. The main thing, however, is that JavaScript objects seem to have more flexibility than in Ruby. In JavaScript, object properties can be written inside curly brackets, outside curly brackets, and a number of other ways. Javascript can also have functions as a property of an object, sort of like classes are able to do in Ruby.
