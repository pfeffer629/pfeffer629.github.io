							<p>Pairing as a part of the DBC Phase 0 experience has been something that I've found to be very beneficial. Like with everything, I think it is something that I have greatly improved in with practice. At first I was unsure about how to benefit from the pairing sessions, as well as, how to be a good pairing partner. With more pairing sessions, however, I have become more comfortable and confident in how to be effective in both regards. </p>

							<p>While solving problems on my own has been very rewarding, I get much more enjoyment when I can share that satisfaction with a partner. It has been a great experience laughing at our silly errors, or sharing the excitement in a breakthrough idea to solve our challenges. </p>

							<p>These rewards did not come without frustrations and difficulties, however. As I said earlier, with the pairing sessions being new to me, I struggled at first. I had some unproductive sessions, and was not a good partner. This has left me regretful, as I left less favorable feedback than my partners probably deserved. I think they did the best they could with me as a partner.</p>

							<p>When I read my feedback, for the most part, I was very pleasantly surprised. Most of my feedback was very encouraging and motivating. It has encouraged me to act more confidently about my coding knowledge. In the future, I will be less hesitant when it comes to sharing my ideas. </p>

							<p>Writing feedback, on the other hand, has been more difficult for me. A lot of the time I struggle with coming up with actionable feedback. I also, as I said, felt that the feedback I left at first was a misrepresentation of my partners. I have had good experiences with all my partners, but I sometimes do not come up with the right words to describe it.</p>

							<p>Overall, I think the pairing has been beneficial. I think it is great practice for the future, and a good way to bounce ideas off other people. It is a good gauge for my skill level, and motivates me to improve.</p></td>
