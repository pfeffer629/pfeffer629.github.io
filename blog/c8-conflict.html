							<p>The last time I had an emotional conflict with someone was with a person that I considered a close friend. We would see each other quite often, and in our conversations, I would reveal a lot of personal thoughts and feelings. There was an incident, however, when he said a lot of hurtful things. He pointed out what he thought were character flaws of mine, but did so in an aggressive and hostile way. He may or may not have been right, but regardless, they were things that no one should ever say to anyone.</p>

							<p>At the time of the conflict, I was calm, and immediately after, I decided that I would no longer accept him as a friend. There have been times when I have seen him after the incident, and we interact cordially, but I no longer take initiative to communicate. </p>

							<p>I don't think my actions made the conflict better. I am glad he expressed his honest feelings, instead of letting a false friendship continue. I think I could have handled myself better afterwards, however. For a while after, I thought of the conversation quite a bit, wondering if the things he said about me were true. If I could go back, I would be more aware of the negative those patterns when they came up.</p>

							<p>I learned a lot from this experience. This wasn't the first time that I decided to cut ties with someone who I thought was my friend, and I don't think it will be the last. I think this experience has built character, and given me more strength to cope with emotionally hurtful situations.</p>

							<p>I also think that my way of handling the situation ties in with how I handle shame. I think that I lean toward withdrawal. I also think that I attack myself a bit, and have negative self talk. I'm glad that I read the article because it is now something that I can be more aware of.</p>
