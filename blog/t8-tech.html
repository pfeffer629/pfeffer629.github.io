							<p>Test driven development or TDD is a way of approaching the process of writing code. In TDD, the goals that the code is intended to accomplish are written first. The code is then written after, and checked to see that it passes the tests.</p> 

							<p>TDD is beneficial because it makes sure that the code is very specific, and can pass very specific tests. It also allows for programmers to write their code one step at a time, by checking it test by test. Another benefit is that no extra code is written because the code only goes test by test.</p>

							<p>There are also problems with the TDD approach. Firstly, tests have to be written out. Secondly, if there are problems with the test, it will be difficult to notice the problems in the code.</p>
