						<td class="blog-entry"><p>Hello young'n. You want to learn about version control, you say? You want to learn about git? Well you've stumbled to the right place, as I, pfeffer629, have completed all the activities in DBC phase 0, week 1.</p>

						<p>First, I will teach you about version control. Version control can be used by anyone who creates, but is especially important for developers. Version control is the process of changing and tracking the changes made. For example, everything I have written now can be called version 1.0 of this blog.</p>

						<p>Now that I have added another sentence, however, the version has now changed to lets say, version 1.1. If I do not like this change, then I can delete the sentence and revert to version 1. If I do like the changes, however, I can keep version 1.1, and continue making tracking changes by naming the new versions.</p>

						<p>In the context of coding, version tracking allows developers to change code. Many developers use something called Git to do this. Git allows users to change and save code. They can upload their code to GitHub, where other users can download that code, and make changes of their own. With so many users changing the same code, there can be many different versions. They are all, however, tracked, and if these users make some bad changes, you don't have to use them.</p>

						<p>Github is great because you can share your genius coding knowledge with the world, and help others that may not be as incredible as you. Others can also make changes to your code, and improve them if somehow, you missed or didn't think of something.</p>

						<p>Incredible.. I know.</p> </td>
