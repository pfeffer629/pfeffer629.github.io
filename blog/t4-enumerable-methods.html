						<p>With the tech world rapidly advancement, many problems arise. One concern that some people have is the lack of women working in the industry. According to a New York Times article called "Technology Man's Problem" by Claire Cain Miller, women only hold 25% of computing occupations. Additionally, 56% of women in the tech industry quit to pursue a completely different career.</p>

						<p>According to the article, many women feel harassed and disrespected by their male counterparts. While it is difficult to know whether these feelings are self imposed insecurities or legitimate, it is easy to see that there is a culture within the tech world that could change to be more welcoming to women. I have seen scholarships to women for coding bootcamps, which is an example of this social change in action. Regardless of these endeavors, technology is still a stereotypically male industry. </p>

						<p>I think that to lessen this huge gap, a change in the culture of the tech industry, but more importantly, society as a whole, is necessary. With gender roles continuously being redefined, it is becoming less strange to see a woman working in tech. Over time, I think men will be more comfortable working with women, and women will be more comfortable working as what was previously considered to be a male profession.</p></td>
