							<p>The video's description of the DBC experience is what drew me to this bootcamp versus the others. The DBC learning experience seems to be based on learning principles rather than facts.</p>

							<p>I liked Shereef's analogy of the different types of bricks. While in fact based learning, we can have a lot of bricks, principle based learning is what gives us the knowledge on how to use them. Not only that, but DBC will give a foundation on how to learn other skills. It's like the fisherman analogy: give a man a fish, feed him for a day; teach a man to fish, feed him for a lifetime. If I learn the principles, I can create code, rather than just memorizing it.</p>

							<p>I think this culture is a perfect match for me. I love learning, and I love learning how to learn more effectively. I am excited to be around like minded people, who will encourage me to be more open to new things.</p></td>
