							<p>Welcome back!</p>

							<p>Today I will teach you the difference between class and IDs. In HTML, sometimes it is important to specify an element, which can be tables, paragraphs, etc. This is necessary because maybe the coder will want to make a change to one paragraph, but not all of them. Or maybe the coder will want to change the font color in certain tables, but not all of them.In order to specify elements, the coder may use classes or IDs. Though they both specify elements, the two are not the same. IDs are specific to one element, while classes can be reused to represent a few.</p>

							<p>Because of this distinction, there are different times that using a class or ID is helpful. A class is useful if there are multiple elements that the coder wants to make the same change to. IDs are used if there is only one element that is to be changed.</p>

							<p>For example, if there are particular paragraphs that the coder wants to be written in red, he or she may classify those paragraphs with a class. That way, only those paragraphs will change, but the rest will remain the same. If there is only one paragrah that the coder wants in red, he or she can give it an id. </p> </td>
