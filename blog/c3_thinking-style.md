Thinking Styles
10/4/14

Taking the thinking style quiz that was a prerequisite to DBC's phase 0 was very insightful. I had an idea of the way I thought, but I never knew of Gregoric's quiz. I ended up scoring very highly in the Abstract Random category, with a lot of points in Abstract Sequential as well. 

I think this thinking style is beneficial in ways, because this style makes it easier for me to visualize how concepts can be used, or how they can interact with each other. I also have an easier time breaking things down into their core concepts, seeing why things work the way they do.

This thinking style, however, also presents a lot of problems, and difficulties. I lack a lot of structure, and do not necessarily produce the best tangible results. Sometimes, I have too many irrelevant ideas, when considering the task at hand. I also care more about the principles than the outcomes.

This is probably my biggest struggle with phase 0 (and life). Once I get a grasp on the principles, I do not put in my best effort to produce the results. I seem to value the understanding more. I know that I need to keep putting in the practice if I want to grasp the concepts more firmly, but I've procrastinating, with the terrible attitude that understanding is enough. I feel that I can do work that is so much better than what I have produced thus far.

Thinking about my thinking, and what has been difficult for me has been very illuminating. It makes me realize my arrogance. Thinking about something and actually are two completely different things. If I really want to be good, I have to put in the time. Moving forward, I will keep this in mind.
