Arrays and Hashes
10/5/14

Welcome back. With week 3 in the books, we've learned a lot about the programming language called Ruby. One major distinction to note is the difference between arrays and hashes. First off, what are arrays and hashes? Simply put, they are both ways of organizing data. 

An array, for example, can look like this: [1, 2, 3]. Each individual number is a part of the array, but no number is the array itself. The array is the collection of numbers as a whole. We could think of a brick house as an analogy. Each brick is part of the house, but no one brick is the house. The house is all the bricks combined.

Hashes are the same in the sense that they also are a collection of data.

How, then, are they different? 

We already saw an example of an array. It takes single pieces of data, and organizes them into a collection. Hashes, however, are more complicated. First off, they dont use simple brackets like arrays. Hashes use the crazy curly ones. A hash could look like this: {:name => "Mark", :age => "24", :birthday => "june 29"}. Looks pretty confusing.. That's ok, though, it will all make sense soon. 

Unlike arrays, which are a collection of single units, hashes are units that come with a corresponding pair. The words with the preceding colon are known as the keys. Each key has a corresponding value. If someone tried to find my name in the example above, they would get Mark. This makes it easy to store large amounts of data, and simplify the process of accessing it.
