							<p>In order to get the answers you need, it is very important to ask questions in the proper way. A question is composed in a number of components such as the title, the problem, and the context. In order to ask the right question, these things all must be considered.</p>

							<p>The title is essential because people will not answer a question with a bad title. It should be specific, and summarize what the question is about. A good tip is to pretend like you are talking to a colleague, and to check that spelling, grammar, and punctuation are correct so that potential readers of your question will take it more seriously.</p>

							<p>Next, you should give the readers information that can help them solve your problem. You can do that by giving examples of code, and the context of your problem. After this, you should proof read your question, and make sure that what you are asking is clear.</p>
